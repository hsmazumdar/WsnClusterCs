nodsz = Get number of nodes
grpssz = Get number of clusters
grpsz[] = Get node size of each clusters (temp only)
dist[][] = Get distance between all nodes

loop1:
	chn = Get furthest node as cluster head node ch_i
	Mark grpsz[i] nearest cluster members state as -1
	Choos new cluster head in center of gravity of i_th cluster as ch_i
	i = i + 1

goodness = sum of distance between all cluster-heads to members
Include nearest members of other groups to each ch by excluding from present group
